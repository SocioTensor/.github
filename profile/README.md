# SocioTensor

## Introduction

Welcome to SocioTensor, a decentralized, blockchain-based social networking platform built as a Bittensor subnet.
SocioTensor leverages the decentralized AI capabilities of Bittensor to create a resilient, secure, and incentivized social network.
Our platform aims to address the challenges of traditional centralized social networks by providing an open, equitable, and decentralized alternative.

## Goal

The primary goals of SocioTensor are:

1. **Decentralization and Independence**
   - Establish a decentralized social networking platform where no single entity has control.
   
2. **Incentivization of Instance Operators**
   - Create a sustainable ecosystem where instance operators (miners) are rewarded for their contributions to the network.
   
3. **Permanent Data Storage**
   - Ensure permanent and reliable storage of user data through decentralized storage solutions such as IPFS and Bittensor storage subnet (sn21).
   
4. **Enhanced User Privacy and Security**
   - Protect user privacy and ensure data security through robust encryption and decentralized consensus mechanisms.
   
5. **Interoperability with AI Models**
   - Integrate AI capabilities to enhance content moderation, recommendations, and user experiences.
   
6. **Community Governance and Moderation**
   - Foster a healthy and self-governed community with decentralized moderation tools and transparent decision-making processes.
